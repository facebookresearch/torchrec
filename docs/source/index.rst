Welcome to the TorchRec documentation!
======================================

TorchRec is a specialized library within the PyTorch ecosystem,
tailored for building, scaling, and deploying large-scale
**recommendation systems**, a niche not directly addressed by standard
PyTorch. TorchRec offers advanced features such as complex sharding
techniques for massive embedding tables, and enhanced distributed
istributed training capabilities.
